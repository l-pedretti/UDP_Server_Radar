* Description: This file contains the task that sets up the user button GPIO 
*              for the publisher and publishes MQTT messages on the topic
*              'MQTT_PUB_TOPIC' to control a device that is actuated by the
*              subscriber task. The file also contains the ISR that notifies
*              the publisher task about the new device state to be published.
